**ABC Change Model**

_**ABC** - (A)CHIEVE, (B)EHAVIOURS, (C)APABILITIES is a small tool created to help coaches, mentors, consultants and their clients quickly and clearly understand what changes in **BEHAVIOURS** and **CAPABILITIES** are needed to sustainably **ACHIEVE** an outcome, with minimal effort and explanation. **ABC** is designed to be simple and small enough to fit on a bar napkin but can easily scale to be used in a range of contexts._



**What is it?**

**ABC** is intended to be a lightweight and memorable coaching, mentoring and consulting tool. It can be used at a variety of levels, from one-on-one coach/client work, within and across teams, and in large-scale organisational change. **ABC** provides a quick and clear way to assess the vision, or target state a client would like to ACHIEVE, that enables them to reach an outcome and then looks at what is needed to enable that.  



**Who is it for?**

Facilitators, Coaches, Mentors, Consultants, Product Managers, Mentors, Organisational Development/Change People. You name it, give it a try and I'll add your profession here.



**More Information**

**ABC** builds on the concept that to ACHIEVE an outcome or form of change, be it personal or organisational, it is necessary to invest energy in creating and changing both _BEHAVIOURS_ and _CAPABILITIES_. 
  - **BEHAVIOURS** are internal to you and me. They are the things we pay attention to, how we see the world, the choices we make, our biases, decision-making processes and proclivities. BEHAVIOURS can sometimes be intrinsic motivators.
    - BEHAVIOURS can be supported and strengthened by external structures - termed CAPABILITIES.
      - _Why not just call them structures?_   Structures didn't begin with a 'C'.   :) 
  - **CAPABILITIES** are things that are external to you and I. They are more often than not tangible and sometimes physical - such as rules, processes, organisational structures, money, metrics, resources, tools and technologies. CAPABILITIES can sometimes be extrinsic motivators.
    - CAPABILITIES can be utilised by our BEHAVIOURS, which can amplify their effectiveness.  



**Even More Information**

For us to successfully ACHIEVE a sustained change towards an outcome, the **ABC** model posits that changes must take place to both BEHAVIOURS and CAPABILITIES. One supports the other. 

  - For us to take advantage of new or changed CAPABILITIES, e.g. resources, tools, processes and information, we often need to change our BEHAVIOURS. Through the availability of new CAPABILITIES, our BEHAVIOURS themselves are changed. 
  - For us to support changes in BEHAVIOUR, is it often necessary to create, acquire, change or develop CAPABILITIES that provide us with structures, processes, information or external motivators. As our BEHAVIOURS change, so do our needs of the CAPABILITIES that support them.

> We shape our tools and, in turn, our tools shape us.

When we invest in one in isolation from the other, an imbalance or debt can occur, e.g. increased energy is directed towards changes in BEHAVIOUR to compensate for the insufficient investment made in changing CAPABILITIES. This might create a scenario where excessive amounts of internal energy, and intrinsic motivation are being invested in maintaining a system, way of working, compensating for the absent structures. Alternatively, a situation might occur where changes are made to CAPABILITIES (processes, tools, or processes example) but without sufficient investment in changes to BEHAVIOURS to support their effective use. This might result in superficial changes to BEHAVIOURS, which when supporting CAPABILITIES are reduced or removed, begin to degrade or regress.

A key concept within **ABC** is that BEHAVIOURS support CAPABILITIES and CAPABILITIES support BEHAVIOURS. There is no linear cause and effect between one and the other. They are seen as entangled and symbiotic. Some have direct effects on the other, others are indirect, and everything in between. 
  - _So why not call it ACB?_   ACB doesn't have the same ring to it as **ABC**.  :) 

But it doesn't end there. It's also possible that as a client unpacks and understands the BEHAVIOURS and CAPABILITIES sought to ACHIEVE an outcome, they may discover that these are not viable, achievable or desirable. This might prompt a reassessment of what they seek to ACHIEVE. B and C also effect A. Again, nothing is simple.



**Quick Start Guide**

**A) The A - What do you want to ACHIEVE?**  
  
  _Consider, right now..._
  
  - What state would you like to change?
  - What action would you like to be able to take that you can't?
  - What would you like to be able to do tomorrow, that you can't do today?
  - What needs to be in place for you to be able to - enter, compete in, or excel in that market/area?

**B) The B - BEHAVIOURS**
  
  _So, to get there, consider..._
  
  - What are the BEHAVIOURS we have right now?
    - These might be; Biases? Decision Making Processes? Our Choices? What we Pay Attention to? What we Value? How we Engage with and Treat Others? Where we Invest our Time and Energy? Our Diet?
  - Do these move us closer towards or further away from what we want to ACHIEVE?
  - What BEHAVIOURS need to change or be encouraged in you, your team or your organisation to move us closer to what you want to ACHIEVE?
    - What kind(s) of changes are these? Doing more of something? Doing less of something? Stopping something? Starting something?
  - _**This is How we get there**_

  _Now you know this, consider what CAPABILITIES are needed to support these BEHAVIOURS?_


**C) The C - CAPABILITIES**
  
  _So, to get there, consider..._
 
  - What are the CAPABILITIES, structures or resources we have right now?
    - These might be; Processes? Metrics? Rules? Policies? Reward and Recognition Systems? Organisational Structures? Tools? Information? Technologies? Money? Resources and Assets?
  - Do these move us closer towards or pull us further away from what we want to ACHIEVE?
  - What CAPABILITIES need to change, whether they are in your control, your teams or your organisations, to move us closer to what you want to ACHIEVE?
    - What kind(s) of changes are these? Changing something? Obtaining Something? Doing more of something? Doing less of something? Stopping something? Starting something?
  - _**This is WHAT we get there**_

  _Now you know this, consider what BEHAVIOURS are needed to utilise these CAPABILITIES?_

FYI - it's possible to get into a loop here, but that's ok, we mentioned these things are often entangled. 



**What's so useful about ABC?**

1) **ABC aims to be simple.** It can help coaches and clients to structure thinking and conversation when working one-on-one, avoiding breaking the flow of coaching conversations (nobody wants that) to draw or illustrate. Consultants can quickly draw it on a bar napkin to frame a conversation with an exec (should they find themselves in a bar). Facilitators can use it on a flipchart or whiteboard when facilitating an event. Workshop participants can easily use it with Post It Notes and Cards to structure discussions.
3) **ABC can be used in different contexts and is complementary.** It doesn't have prerequisites or form part of any framework. If you like using techniques like Clean Language you can add them into **ABC**. Like Co-Active Coaching? Sure, combine **ABC** with Co-Active too. When working in a team, product or technology context, **ABC** can complement other tools such as Impact Mapping and User Story Mapping, shaping work, clarifying or expanding. The end goal isn't **ABC**, the end goal is helping clients clarify what they need on their path to their end goal.
4) **ABC can be sliced, lined up and stacked.** **ABC** as a tool is designed to be small and compact. We know that big things often come from small changes. And smaller changes are easier to visualise, convey, decide on the steps to get there, make progress towards, measure that progress and see the result. We can abandon smaller things quicker if they're not right for us, don't feel right or the destination has changed. So like a large Epic that can be broken into smaller User Stories, it's possible to break down a large **ABC** into smaller **ABCs**. **ABCs** can be stacked in a linear way, where one **ABC** leads to another. That means when you ACHIEVE one, you ACHIEVE something. That's banked and a foundation to build on for the next one. You never lose it, it's great for measuring progress and it's great for the client. Or you can have multiple **ABCs** taking place at any one time. This might be more useful in an organisation context, where you aim want to ACHIEVE a much larger change (or 'transformation') that requires multiple achievements and outcome that ladder into each other, becoming greater than the sum of their parts. Remember, bigger isn't always better and simple is easy to convey. 



**Limitations and Notes**

1) This does not consider 'the Why' a person, team or organisation would like to ACHIEVE something. That is for the client and coach to understand as part of the work they do. **ABC** is only concerned with the path to get there. **ABC** can be used at any time in a coaching conversation, but a coach should be mindful to avoid a premature move to action and change before the Problem and Person are understood.
2) Clients should consider and reflect on whether the BEHAVIOURS and CAPABILITIES identified are 'right for them'. During the use of **ABC** there is a high possibility that a client will uncover that the means to ACHIEVE the outcome being sought does not align with their own values, are not viable or achievable within their constraints or systems.  This is useful information for both parties, providing the opportunity to change assess progress and decide where to go next.
