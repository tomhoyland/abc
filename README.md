ABC

What is it?

ABC is intended to be a lightweight coaching, mentoring and consulting tool. It can be used at a range of levels, from one-on-one coach/client work, to team(s) and in large-scale organisational change. It provides a quick and clear way to assess the vision or target state a client would like to Achieve that enables them to reach and outcome and then looks back to what is needed to enable that. ABC builds on the idea that in order to achieve an outcome, we need to change not just our tools, processes and resources (our Capabilities), but also how we interact with them - ourselves and the human side of change (our Behaviours). We (A)chieve our outcomes by developing (B)ehaviours and (C)apabilities - ABC.

What's so cool about it?

1) ABC aims to be simple - so coaches and clients can visualise it when working one-on-one reducing the need to draw or illustrate, avoiding breaking the flow of coaching conversations (nobody wants that), consultants can quickly draw it on a bar napkin to frame a conversation with an exec (should they find themselves in a bar), facilitators can draw it quickly on a flipchart or whiteboard when facilitating an event.
2) ABC can be used in different contexts. It doesn't have prerequisites or form part of any framework. If you like using techniques like Clean Language you can add them into ABC. Like Co-Active Coaching? Sure, supplement ABC with Co-Active too - it doesn't care. When working in a team, product or technology context, ABC can complement other tools such as Impact Mapping and User Story Mapping. 
3) ABC can be sliced, lined up and stacked. ABC as a tool is designed to be small and compact. We know that big things often come from small changes. And smaller changes are easier to visualise, convey, decide on the steps to get there, make progress towards, measure that progress and see the result. We can abandon smaller things quicker if they're not right for us, don't feel right or the destination has changed. So like a large Epic that can be broken into smaller User Stories, it's possible to break down a large ABC into smaller ABCs. ABCs can be stacked in a linear way, where one ABC leads to another. That means when you achieve one, you achieve something. That's banked and a foundation to build on for the next one. You never lose it, it's great for measuring progress and it's great for the client. Or you can have multiple ABCs taking place at any one time. This might be more useful in an organisation context, where you aim want to achieve a much larger change of state that requires multiple levels of achievement and outcome that ladder into each other, becoming greater than the sum of their parts. Remember, bigger isn't always better and simple is easy to convey. 

The A - What do you want to Achieve?
  
  Consider, right now...
  What state would you like to change?
  What Action would you like to be able to take that you can't?
  What would you like to be able to do tomorrow, that you can't do today?

The B - Behaviours

To get there, consider...
  
What behaviours need to change, be it in yourself, your team or your organisation 
    Biases? Decision Making? What we pay attention to?
    What kind of changes are these? Doing more of something? Doing less of something? Stopping something? Starting something?
    Do these changes move us closer towards or further away from where we want to go?

The C - Capabilities

To get there, consider...
 
What Capabilities and Resources need to change, be in in your own control, your team or your organisation
    Processes? Metrics? Rules? Policies? Reward and Recognition systems? Organisational Structures? Tools? Information? 
    What kind of changes are these? Doing more of something? Doing less of something? Stopping something? Starting something?
    Do these changes move us closer towards or further away from where we want to go?
