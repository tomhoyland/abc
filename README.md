**ABC Change Model**

_The ACHIEVE, BEHAVIOURS, CAPABILITIES **(ABC)** Change Model is a small tool created to help coaches, mentors, consultants and their clients quickly and clearly understand what changes in **BEHAVIOURS** and **CAPABILITIES** are needed to sustainably **ACHIEVE** an outcome, with minimal effort and explanation. **ABC** is designed to be simple and small enough to fit on a bar napkin, stay in your head and easily scale to be used in a range of contexts._ 



**What is it?**

**ABC** is intended to be a lightweight and memorable coaching, mentoring and consulting tool, providing high value and extensibility, with low energy to adoption. It can be used at a variety of levels, from one-on-one coach/client work, to within and across teams, and in large-scale organisational change. **ABC** provides a quick and clear way to assess the vision or target state a client would like to ACHIEVE, which enables them to reach an outcome and then looks at what is needed to enable that. **ABC is simple on the surface, but has depth.**  



**Who is it for?**

Facilitators, Coaches, Mentors, Consultants, Product Managers, Mentors, Leaders, Organisational Development/Change People. You name it, give it a try and I'll add your profession here.



**Key Concepts**

**ABC** builds on the concept that to ACHIEVE an outcome or form of change, be it personal or organisational, it is necessary to invest energy in creating and changing both _BEHAVIOURS_ and _CAPABILITIES_. 
  - **BEHAVIOURS** are internal to you and me.
    - They are the things we pay attention to, how we see the world, the choices we make, how we spend our time, our biases, decision-making processes and proclivities.
    - BEHAVIOURS can sometimes be intrinsic motivators.
    - BEHAVIOURS are demonstrable activities and can be seen. 
    - As long as we are here, our BEHAVIOURS exist. When we are no longer here, neither are our BEHAVIOURS.
    - BEHAVIOURS can be supported and strengthened by external structures - termed CAPABILITIES.
  - **CAPABILITIES** are things that are external to you and me.
    - They are more often than not tangible and sometimes physical.
    - CAPABILITIES are things that we lean on, support us and can sustain us during our journey.
    - CAPABILITIES can be; rules, processes, organisational structures, money, metrics, resources, communities, networks, incentive and reward systems, hiring practices tools and technologies.
    - CAPABILITIES can sometimes be extrinsic motivators.
    - When we are no longer here, CAPABILITIES remain.
    - CAPABILITIES can be utilised by our BEHAVIOURS, which can amplify their effectiveness.



**The Thinking Behind ABC**

For us to successfully ACHIEVE a sustained change towards an outcome, the **ABC** model posits that changes must take place to both BEHAVIOURS and CAPABILITIES. One supports the other. 

  - For us to take advantage of new or changed CAPABILITIES, e.g. resources, tools, processes and information, we often need to change our BEHAVIOURS. Through the availability of new CAPABILITIES, our BEHAVIOURS themselves are changed. 
  - For us to support changes in BEHAVIOUR, is it often necessary to create, acquire, change or develop CAPABILITIES that provide us with structures, processes, information or external motivators. As our BEHAVIOURS change, so do our needs of the CAPABILITIES that support them.

> We shape our tools and, in turn, our tools shape us.

When we invest in one in isolation from the other, an imbalance or debt can occur, e.g. increased energy is directed towards changes in BEHAVIOUR to compensate for the insufficient investment made in changing CAPABILITIES. This might create a scenario where excessive amounts of internal energy, and intrinsic motivation are being invested in maintaining a system, way of working, compensating for the absent structures. Alternatively, a situation might occur where changes are made to CAPABILITIES (processes, tools, or processes example) but without sufficient investment in changes to BEHAVIOURS to support their effective use. This might result in superficial changes to BEHAVIOURS, which when supporting CAPABILITIES are reduced or removed, begin to degrade or regress.

A key concept within **ABC** is that BEHAVIOURS support CAPABILITIES and CAPABILITIES support BEHAVIOURS. There is no linear cause and effect between one and the other. They are seen as entangled and symbiotic. Some have direct effects on the other, others are indirect, and everything in between. 
  - _So why not call it ACB?_   ACB doesn't have the same ring to it as **ABC**.  :) 

But it doesn't end there. It's also possible that as a client unpacks and understands the BEHAVIOURS and CAPABILITIES sought to ACHIEVE an outcome, they may discover that these are not viable, achievable or desirable. This might prompt a reassessment of what they seek to ACHIEVE. B and C also affect A. Again, nothing is simple.



**Quick Start Guide**

**Bind the Terms**

Before you get going, it's useful to define and explain what the terms Behaviours and Capabilities mean in the context of ABC. These terms may have existing meanings to an individual or organisation, so it's important to bind them to this context.


**A) The A - What do you want to ACHIEVE?**  
  
  _Consider, right now..._
  
  - What state would you like to change?
  - What action would you like to be able to take that you can't?
  - What would you like to be able to do tomorrow, that you can't do today?
  - What needs to be in place for you to be able to - enter, compete in, or excel in that market/area?

**B) The B - BEHAVIOURS**
  
  _So, to get there, consider..._
  
  - What are the BEHAVIOURS we have right now?
    - These might be; Biases? Decision Making Processes? Our Choices? What we Pay Attention to? What we Value? How we Engage with and Treat Others? Where we Invest our Time and Energy? Our Diet?
  - Do these move us closer towards or further away from what we want to ACHIEVE?
  - What BEHAVIOURS need to change or be encouraged in you, your team or your organisation to move us closer to what you want to ACHIEVE?
    - What kind(s) of changes are these? Doing more of something? Doing less of something? Stopping something? Starting something?
  - _**This is HOW we get there with WHAT we have**_

  _Now you know this, consider what CAPABILITIES are needed to support these BEHAVIOURS?_


**C) The C - CAPABILITIES**
  
  _So, to get there, consider..._
 
  - What are the CAPABILITIES, structures or resources we have right now?
    - These might be; Processes? Metrics? Rules? Policies? Reward and Recognition Systems? Organisational Structures? Tools? Information? Technologies? Money? Resources and Assets?
  - Do these move us closer towards or pull us further away from what we want to ACHIEVE?
  - What CAPABILITIES need to change, whether they are in your control, your teams or your organisations, to move us closer to what you want to ACHIEVE?
    - What kind(s) of changes are these? Changing something? Obtaining Something? Doing more of something? Doing less of something? Stopping something? Starting something?
  - _**This is WHAT we need to support HOW get there**_

  _Now you know this, consider what BEHAVIOURS are needed to utilise these CAPABILITIES?_

FYI - it's possible to get into a loop here, but that's ok, we mentioned these things are often entangled. 



**What's so useful about ABC?**

1) **ABC aims to be simple.** It can help coaches and clients to structure thinking and conversation when working one-on-one, avoiding breaking the flow of coaching conversations (nobody wants that) to draw or illustrate. Consultants can quickly draw it on a bar napkin to frame a conversation with an exec (should they find themselves in a bar). Facilitators can use it on a flipchart or whiteboard when facilitating an event. Workshop participants can easily use it with Post It Notes and Cards to structure discussion, using ABC across multiple groups supported by diverge-converge practicies and techniques such as 1-2-4-All.
2) **ABC is an easy way to explain to others what effective Coaches and Consultants do.** It provides immediate access to two concepts that are neccesary for individuals or organisations to investigate change and move towards achieving a goal. ABC helps clients to identify Behaviours or Capabilities areas to review, change, adapt or explore in pursuit of a goal, but then provides direct access to higher level content, which emphasises and reveals that sustained change in one area, requires support and adjustment made in another. 
3) **ABC can be used in different contexts and is complementary.** It doesn't have prerequisites or form part of any framework. If you like using techniques like Clean Language you can add them into **ABC**. Like Co-Active Coaching? Sure, combine **ABC** with Co-Active too. When working in a team, product or technology context, **ABC** can complement other tools such as Impact Mapping and User Story Mapping, shaping work, clarifying or expanding. The end goal isn't **ABC**, the end goal is helping clients clarify what they need on their path to their end goal.
4) **ABC is useful throughout a coaching and consulting journey.** ABC can be used at the beginning, middle and end.

   4.1. In early engagements ABC provides a quick way for clients to get started and identify what changes could be explored as part of their journey towards the outcome they want to achieve. This enables an early backlog of experiments, ideas and action to be created, which is balanced between Behaviours and Capabilities, and can be pursued by the client with the consultant, outlining key deliverable, allowing for fast feedback, adjustment and refinement.

   4.2. In situations where change programmes are in progress and encountering resistance, or regressing, ABC provides a helpful interuption, providing a simple tool to allow teams leading change and teams experience change to express what Behaviours and/or Capabilities are moving counter to the intent of what an organisation wishes to achieve. This can prompt refinement and adjustment of change strategies and their actions, reducing friction and exposing more of the 'system' to change practitioners.

   > ABC cuts through the noise to reveal what is happening, makes thing more open, allows the dots to be connected and healthier conversations to happen.

   4.2.1. As ABC is easy to use, it can quickly be deployed across mulitple groups and different levels of seniority to provide a comprehensive assessment of how a strategy or goal might be achieved. These exercises can reveal when suggested changes to Behaviours and/or Capability determined by one group as supporting the pursuit of an goal, is also a detractor for another group. ABC provides a simple tool to access this information and provide a route for dialogue during periods of change.

   4.3. ABC is a useful tool in one to one coaching, as coaches and clients move towards action and change. Here, ABC provides useful prompts and considerations for what needs to happen for a client's desired change to happen, be sustained and successful. 
6) **ABC can be sliced, lined up and stacked.** **ABC** as a tool is designed to be small and compact. We know that big things often come from small changes. And smaller changes are easier to visualise, convey, decide on the steps to get there, make progress towards, measure that progress and see the result. We can abandon smaller things quicker if they're not right for us, don't feel right or the destination has changed. So like a large Epic that can be broken into smaller User Stories, it's possible to break down a large **ABC** into smaller **ABCs**. **ABCs** can be stacked in a linear way, where one **ABC** leads to another. That means when you ACHIEVE one, you ACHIEVE something. That's banked and a foundation to build on for the next one. You never lose it, it's great for measuring progress and it's great for the client. Or you can have multiple **ABCs** taking place at any one time. This might be more useful in an organisation context, where you aim want to ACHIEVE a much larger change (or 'transformation') that requires multiple achievements and outcomes that ladder into each other, becoming greater than the sum of their parts. Remember, bigger isn't always better and simple is easy to convey. 



**Limitations and Notes**

1) This does not consider 'the Why' a person, team or organisation would like to ACHIEVE something. That is for the client and coach to understand as part of the work they do. **ABC** is only concerned with the path to get there. **ABC** can be used at any time in a coaching conversation, but a coach should be mindful to avoid a premature move to action and change before the Problem and Person are understood.
2) Clients should consider and reflect on whether the BEHAVIOURS and CAPABILITIES identified are 'right for them'. During the use of **ABC** there is a high possibility that a client will uncover that the means to ACHIEVE the outcome being sought does not align with their own values, are not viable or achievable within their constraints or systems.  This is useful information for both parties, providing the opportunity to change assess progress and decide where to go next.
